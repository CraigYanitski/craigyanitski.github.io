Emission from carbon monoxide (CO) and its isotopologues traces the bulk of molecular gas and provides constraints on the physical conditions through their line ratios. However, a comprehensive understanding of how the particular choice of line modeling approach impacts derived molecular properties remains incomplete. Here, we study the nearby starburst galaxy M82, known for its intense star formation and molecular emission, using the large set of available multi-CO line observations. We present high-resolution (∼85 pc) emission of seven CO isotopologue lines, including 12CO, 13CO, and C18O from the J = 1–0, 2–1, and 3–2 transitions. Using RADEX for radiative transfer modeling, we analyze M82\u0026rsquo;s molecular properties with (i) a one-zone model and (ii) a variable density model, comparing observed and simulated emissions via a minimum χ2 analysis. We find that inferred gas conditions—kinetic temperature and density—are consistent across models, with minimal statistical differences. However, due to their low critical densities (\u0026lt;104 cm‑3), low-J CO isotopologue lines do not effectively probe higher-density gas prevalent in starburst environments like that of M82. Our results further imply that this limitation extends to high-redshift (z ⪆ 1) galaxies with similar conditions, where low-J CO lines are inadequate for density constraints. Future studies of extreme star-forming regions like M82 will require higher-J CO lines or alternative molecular tracers with higher critical densities.\nADS\n","date":"1 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/zhang-et-al.-2025/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Zhang et al. 2025","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"29 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/invited-talk/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Invited Talk","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/talks/","section":"Talks","summary":"","title":"Talks","type":"talks"},{"content":"","date":"29 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/university-of-alberta/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"University of Alberta","type":"tags"},{"content":"This was an invited presentation for the astronomy community at the University of Alberta.

We investigate the dynamical and physical structures of bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs) in a nearby H II region. We focused on carbon- and oxygen-bearing species that trace photon-dominated regions (PDRs) and warm molecular cloud surfaces in order to understand the effect of UV radiation from the exciting stars on the cloud structure. Methods. We mapped four regions around the most prominent BRCs at scales of 4–10 arcmin in the H II region IC 1396 (IC 1396A, B, D, and E) in [C II] 158 µm with (up)GREAT on board SOFIA. IC 1396 is predominantly excited by an O6.5V star. Toward IC 1396A, we also observed [O I] 63 µm and 145 µm. We combined these observations with JCMT archive data, which provide the low-J transitions of CO, 13CO, and C18O. All spectra are velocity-resolved. Results. The line profiles in the four mapped regions show a variety of velocity structures, which we investigated in detail for all observed emission lines. IC 1396B and D show clearly distinct velocity components that overlap along the line of sight. We find no clear sign of photoevaporating flows in the [C II] spectra, although the uncertainty in the location of the BRCs along the line of sight makes this interpretation inconclusive. Our analysis of the [13C II] emission in IC1396 A, which has the best signal-to-noise ratio, suggests that the [C II] is likely mostly optically thin. The heating efficiency, measured by the ([C II]+[O I] 63 µm)/far-infrared intensity ratio, is higher in the northern part of IC 1396A than in the southern part, which may indicate a difference in the dust properties of the two areas. Conclusions. The complex velocity structures identified in the BRCs of IC 1396, which is apparently a relatively simple H II region, highlight the importance of velocity-resolved data for disentangling different components along the line of sight and thus facilitating a detailed study of the dynamics of the cloud. We also demonstrate that the optically thin [13C II] and [O I] 145 µm emission lines are essential for a conclusive interpretation of the [C II] 158 µm and [O I] 63 µm line profiles.\nADS\n","date":"1 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/okada-et-al.-2024/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Okada et al. 2024","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"1 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/photon-dominated-region-pdr/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Photon-Dominated Region (PDR)","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/center-for-astrophysics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Center for Astrophysics","type":"tags"},{"content":"This was an invited talk for the Radio Millimeter Submillimeter group during my research visit.

While the numerous features of the Galactic ISM observation cannot be matched simultaneously by a test model, the large-scale structure and the typical line ratios and intensities should be reproduced in a statistically signiﬁcant way. To that end, previous research has utilised the KOSMA-τ photon-dissociation region (PDR) code to ﬁt the line emission as observed with COBE-FIRAS with very few assumptions and constraints. The basis of this work was the fractal structure of the ISM: a theory that accounts for the high surface-to-volume ratio as inferred from observations allowing the sophisticated post-processing of self-consistent model results. I have now extended this approach to arbitrary geometries in the novel PDR code kosmatau3d, which also accounts for the dust pumping, continuum emission, and absorption effects. The code uniquely accounts for the clumpy structure of the inhomogeneous ISM. I have used this code to model the molecular and atomic cold neutral medium (CNM) in the Milky Way using axisymmetric distributions of the dense and diffuse gas mass (traced with atomic and molecular hydrogen), average density, cosmic ray ionisation rate, and far-UV radiation. I ﬁnd that much of the observed large-scale structure in the spectroscopic maps can be replicated in the synthetic observations, though there remains difficulty to fully model the self-absorption features toward the Galactic centre. I also ﬁnd these kosmatau3d synthetic observations are able to replicate the molecular ring and certain Galactic arm features even without an explicit implementation of the spiral structure of the Milky Way. This suggests the structure seen in the galactic position-velocity diagram arises to a large extent from the rotation of the galaxy and the molecular ring, and thus offers insight into the interpretation of galactic longitude-velocity diagrams. I also summarise the beneﬁt of using multiple transition lines in the constraining of the Milky Way parameters, how these constraints improve on and differ from previous work, and ﬁnally conclude with an outlook on this method of modelling and how well the Galactic cooling lines can be modelled using PDRs.\nKUPS\n","date":"21 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/yanitski-2023/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Yanitski 2023","type":"publications"},{"content":"This was an invited talk for one of the groups working on MHD simpulations.

In particular, the 12CII transition from the GOT C+ project is used to constrain the far-UV radiation in the Galaxy.
