## My research

My research concerns the understanding radiative transfer in the inhomogeneous ISM 
and some of the observational artefacts that cloud our interpretation.
During my doctoral studies at the I. Physikalisches Institut der Universität zu Köln, 
Germany, I developed a novel clumpy photo-dissociation region (PDR) model 
[`kosmatau3d`]({{< ref="projects/kosmatau3d/index.md" >}}).
I have used this code to model the Galactic cooling lines in the Milky Way 
(Yanitski 2023).
There is an obvious computational limitation in modelling the emission over such a 
large volume that the simulations could only resolve scales down to ~500 pc.
To address some of these concerns raised during my Ph.D., I have also been developing 
model of individual HII region bubbles such as IC 1396 (Okada et al. 2024) as well 
galactic objects such as M82 (Zhang et al. 2025).

From 2024 I have been focusing more attention on developing a holistic view of 
HII regions including their environments (which by definition are PDRs).
This ongoing work is done in preparation for and adds a modelling aspect to 
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Phase V Local Volume Mapper (LVM) consortium.
