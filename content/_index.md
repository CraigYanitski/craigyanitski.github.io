Welcome to my website!
I am a computational astrophysicist with >10 years' experience in programming.
I have the most experience with an interpreted language like python, though I do prefer 
statically typed languages like C++, Rust, and Golang.
I also enjoy working from the command line, so I will probably make some projects for bash and vim soon.

My coding summary, for those interested, includes coding in Python (>10 years), 
coding in C++ (~10 years), working with relational DBs in SQL (~5 years), and I
have been working in Golang and Rust in the past several months.

I am a freelance data scientist and software engineer, and you can contract my services 
on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/s/VYZx0eY).
I am more than happy to discuss ways I can meet the needs of your project.

And my work summary for the science people is given in the [Research]({{<ref "research/index.md">}}) section, 
but the main focus is radiation transport in the inhomogeneous interstellar medium (ISM) with 
a focus on simulating this with photodissociation region (PDR) models.
