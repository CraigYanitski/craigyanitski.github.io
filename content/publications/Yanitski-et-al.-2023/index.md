**Title:** Constraining the Galactic far-UV field using a clumpy PDR model 

**Authors:**  Yanitski, C. N.; Ossenkopf-Okada, V.; Röllig, M.

**Abstract:**  We model the Milky Way ISM dust continuum and far-infrared line transitions using the novel clumpy PDR code kttd.
In particular, the 12CII transition from the GOT C+ project is used to constrain the far-UV radiation in the Galaxy.
We find that the far-UV radiation within 1.2 kpc of the Galactic centre needs to be increased to ∼100χ\subD in order to explain the self absorption at l=0 using our 400 pc models.
This constraint however worsens the fit to neighbouring sightlines due to the large voxel size.
