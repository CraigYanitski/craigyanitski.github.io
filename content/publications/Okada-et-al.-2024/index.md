**Abstract:** Aims. We investigate the dynamical and physical structures of bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs) in a nearby H II region. We focused on carbon- and oxygen-bearing species that trace photon-dominated regions (PDRs) and warm molecular cloud surfaces in order to understand the effect of UV radiation from the exciting stars on the cloud structure. Methods. We mapped four regions around the most prominent BRCs at scales of 4–10 arcmin in the H II region IC 1396 (IC 1396A, B, D, and E) in [C II] 158 µm with (up)GREAT on board SOFIA. IC 1396 is predominantly excited by an O6.5V star. Toward IC 1396A, we also observed [O I] 63 µm and 145 µm. We combined these observations with JCMT archive data, which provide the low-J transitions of CO, 13CO, and C18O. All spectra are velocity-resolved. Results. The line profiles in the four mapped regions show a variety of velocity structures, which we investigated in detail for all observed emission lines. IC 1396B and D show clearly distinct velocity components that overlap along the line of sight. We find no clear sign of photoevaporating flows in the [C II] spectra, although the uncertainty in the location of the BRCs along the line of sight makes this interpretation inconclusive. Our analysis of the [13C II] emission in IC1396 A, which has the best signal-to-noise ratio, suggests that the [C II] is likely mostly optically thin. The heating efficiency, measured by the ([C II]+[O I] 63 µm)/far-infrared intensity ratio, is higher in the northern part of IC 1396A than in the southern part, which may indicate a difference in the dust properties of the two areas. Conclusions. The complex velocity structures identified in the BRCs of IC 1396, which is apparently a relatively simple H II region, highlight the importance of velocity-resolved data for disentangling different components along the line of sight and thus facilitating a detailed study of the dynamics of the cloud. We also demonstrate that the optically thin [13C II] and [O I] 145 µm emission lines are essential for a conclusive interpretation of the [C II] 158 µm and [O I] 63 µm line profiles.
