This is the clumpy photodissociation (PDR) code I developed during my Ph.D.
I wrote the code in its current state and I am currently the leading expert in its use.
you can find more information about it in the [documentation](https://kosmatau3d.readthedocs.io)
or my [thesis](https://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/71850/).
The current maintainer is [Aditi Sinha](https://github.com/aditi0009).
We jointly have 3-4 projects we are working on to publish (eg. my Ph.D. work), 
analyse (eg. Aditi's sensitivity analysis), or develop (eg. our M82 collaboration).
Despite our continued development of debugging of the code, it is *science-ready* and 
useful for current ISM radiative emission research.
Contact either [myself](mailto:yanitski@ph1.uni-koeln.de) or 
[Aditi](mailto:sinha@ph1.uni.koeln.de) if you would like to discuss the model in detail.
